# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction System

This project is a full-stack machine learning application to predict customer churn. It includes:

- ✅ A trained churn prediction model (`churn_model.pkl`)
- ⚙️ A FastAPI backend for serving predictions
- 📊 A Streamlit dashboard for visualization
- 🐳 Docker setup for easy deployment

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. ✅ Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Docker Desktop
- Python 3.8+ (only if training locally)
- (Optional) PostgreSQL client for DB inspection

---

### 2. 🧠 Train the Model (Optional)

If you want to train your own model:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn joblib
python train_model.py
```

Move the generated `churn_model.pkl` to the `model/` directory.

---

### 3. 🐳 Run with Docker

```bash
cd customer_churn_prediction_system
docker-compose up --build
```
